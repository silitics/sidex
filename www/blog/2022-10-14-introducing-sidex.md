We are excited to introduce [Sidex](https://github.com/silitics/sidex)! 🎉

Sidex is a format- and language-agnostic data modeling and API definition framework with a focus on type safety, extensibility, and developer ergonomics. With Sidex, we are on a mission to simplify data exchange across our (and maybe your?) entire stack.

Note that at the time of writing this post, Sidex is still under heavy construction.
